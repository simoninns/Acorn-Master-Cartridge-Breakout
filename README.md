# Acorn-Master-Cartridge-Breakout
A breakout adapter for the Acorn Master 128 cartridge interface for connection to a breadboard

## Synopsis

This card is designed to allow connection between an Acorn BBC Master's cartridge interface and an electronics breadboard.  To save production cost the board is designed as two PCBs.  The cartridge header should be produced with a gold finish due to the edge connector (this is not required for the breadboard header).

## Motivation

Prototyping new Acorn BBC Master hardware.

## Author

The Acorn Master Cartridge Breakout board was designed by Simon Inns.
